hello

I decided to create a web portfolio besause thats what I like about this course and wouldconsider doing something in that field, so started to create a web portfolio about front end developet in making. I can also use this as my portfolio piece showing the work i have done so far.

Created an index page put all the head and meta stuff, i didn't have a specific mockup just wanted to create something from scratch.

I decided that I need 3 responsive pages: home, project and contact. Add a massive and exeburant animation, show my previous projects in web design and a pretty contact page with formatting.

I started to create the code.

Decided to use sass for two reasons, first its awesome and second its gonna save me hours to write my code. Talk about modularity, yes please.

so started creating the basic navigation with lists and then started adding the content and everything in the index file.

Then created scss file, now I named it golbal.scss because i am gonna specify all the variables in the golbal and then import them into each pages induvidual scss files so that my code remains neat and clean and modular.

I got all my icons and svgs from figma and iconmonster. I decided to use as much svgs because i wanted to code some with some colours and gradients.

Downloaded the main illustration in the home page from undraw.com because they have the best illustrations and I can download them in svg. Put my illustration in figma and then exported it from it. Now I did this because in figma i can add id's to each element in a massive illustration and then can animate them using code.

Then wanted a splash like thing to my homepage so i created that in figma and gave it a gradient.

Created intro.scss for the homepage and then import that to global.scss added all the navigation and then started to animate the illustration.

I didnt used href for linking my illustration instead imported all id's in the index.html so that I can animate the induvidual components.

Then the basic coding for the project and contact page and everything else was going smoothly.

But after that i got into a problem, I wanted to put a fancy gradient in my name on the homepage. But the gradient on my name on the homepage was showing in form of a block in front of my text instead of applying to the text. Tried a lot to solve that then thought of checking it in another browser, luckily it was working in firefox but not in chrome or safari.

My website was 80% complete but only this thing was bothering me, then after hours of searching added -webkit-background-clip:text; and bam. fixed my issue, thankyou csstricks.com

completed my code took like 17 hours to make then took the picyures for mockup(pardon me for that i was just lazy and didn't create a whole new XD file and create a mockup and then code it cause i am not that good of anprogrammer and would have to change the mockup to look like my website than the website to look like a mockup)

if you made this far, great have a nice day Sir!
